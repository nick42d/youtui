# To allow alternative TLS options, we need to opt out of a single reqwest feature.
# This isn't possible in Cargo, so we need to opt back into the other default features.

# As of 26/4/24 the following are reqwest default features:
# http2, default-tls, charset

[features]
# Provide alternative TLS options, but use reqwest's default by default.
# NOTE: To use an alternative TLS, you will need to specify default-features = false
# As reqwest preferentially uses default-tls when multiple TLS features are enabled.
# See reqwest docs for more information.
# https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/tls/index.html
# TODO: Implement builder functions that allow us to ensure we use a specific TLS.
