### Added
- [**breaking**] Let queries take iterators as params ([#238](https://github.com/nick42d/youtui/pull/238))
- _This is mostly done in a non-breaking way, however if you were using explicit type parameters for iterators on some simplified queries they have been removed_ 
- [**breaking**]: Allow queries to be run without authentication ([#227](https://github.com/nick42d/youtui/pull/227))
- _This is a breaking change, as some queries are now restricted to only run when authenticated_
- _This also includes a refactor of query, reducing the number of re-exports, meaning some query parameters like SpellingMode now need to be imported more explicitely_
- _In addition, type of PodcastChannelTopResult has changed whilst fixing tests_
- _In addition, ErrorKind::BrowserAuthenticationFailed has been removed, as when fixing tests it was realised it isn't reliably detected_
